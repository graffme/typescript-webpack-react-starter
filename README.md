# Typescript + Webpack + React starter

The motivation to create the project was to learn how to use some popular technologies all together.

This starter includes:
* [Typescript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/index.html) (to type everything and make a use of Interfaces)
* [TSLint](https://palantir.github.io/tslint/) (for Typescript)
* [Webpack](https://webpack.js.org/) (as module bundler)
* [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) (JavaScript compiler)
* [ts-loader](https://github.com/TypeStrong/ts-loader) and [fork-ts-checker-webpack-plugin](https://github.com/Realytics/fork-ts-checker-webpack-plugin) (for Typescript and Webpack to work together)
* [React](https://reactjs.org/) (for view layer)
* [SASS](https://sass-lang.com/) (for styles)
* [Jest](https://jestjs.io/) and [Enzyme](https://github.com/airbnb/enzyme) (for tests)
